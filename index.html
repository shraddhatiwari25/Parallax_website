            <p class="text">
                German Shepherds are attractive dogs: large and muscular with a signature square muzzle, bushy tail, and
                (usually) black mask. They’re generally tan/black or red/black in coloring, often with “saddle” and
                “blanket” markings across the back. Rarer colorings include sable, silver, liver, and panda. There are
                even pure black German Shepherds and white German Shepherds.
                German Shepherds typically have a dense double coat with a water-resistant outer layer and a thick
                undercoat. And they’re most definitely shedders. These dogs typically shed once or twice per year, but
                they benefit from weekly grooming. (As well as daily brushing during shedding months.)
                <br> <br>
                Although most German Shepherds have either a medium or long coat,
                some German Shepherds have no undercoat, and therefore have different grooming needs.
                Make sure to learn how to care for your GSDs coat properly and maximize the natural benefits of their
                hair, while minimizing out-of-control shedding. If in doubt, check with a groomer who can give you tips
                on good home care.

            <p class="text">
                German Shepherds are generally a healthy breed, but like all dogs, they may be prone to certain health
                issues.
                <br> <br>
                It's important to keep your German Shepherd up-to-date on regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations,
                and preventative care to help maintain their overall health and wellbeing. Providing your German
                Shepherd with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and attention to their overall mental health can also go
                a long way in keeping them healthy.

            <p class="text">
                German Shepherds are a breed of dog that originated in Germany in the late 19th century. They were
                originally bred as working dogs, specifically for herding and guarding livestock. Today, German
                Shepherds are still used for these purposes, but they are also popular as family pets, law enforcement
                dogs, and search and rescue dogs.
                <br> <br>
                German Shepherds are a beloved breed for their intelligence, loyalty, and versatility. However, they are
                not a good fit for everyone, and it's important to research the breed thoroughly before bringing one
                into your home.
